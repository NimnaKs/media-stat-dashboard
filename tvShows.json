Born in Colombo in 1955, he came from a politically active family. His father, Reggie Mendis, was a leading figure in the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), deeply involved in the 1953 Hartal and other historic struggles. Reggie’s activism and sacrifices, including his leadership role during clashes with colonial authorities, left a lasting impact on Lakshman’s outlook and sense of discipline.\n\nEducated at Royal College, Colombo, Mendis initially worked at the Embilipitiya Paper Mill, where his involvement in trade union activities led to his dismissal. He later studied gemology and became a successful gem merchant before entering the creative world of cinema and television. His friendship with the late Vijaya Kumaratunga drew him into politics as a coordinating secretary of the Mahajana Party, but it was acting that became his lifelong passion.\n\nMendis began his acting career in 1985 with Gangulen Egodata, directed by Dr. Dharmasena Pathiraja. His role in Pathiraja’s landmark series Kadulla soon made him a household name. In cinema, his breakout role came with Demodara Palama (1995), where he played “Bryan” — a performance that won him the Best Upcoming Actor award at the Sarasaviya Festival. He went on to star in acclaimed films such as Anjalika, Machan, Peeter One, Sakkarang, Dekala Purudu Kenek, and Nidahase Piya DS, where he portrayed Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake.\n\nOn television, he gained iconic status through series that combined art with social critique. His most notable television role was in Koombiyo (2016), a political crime thriller that became Sri Lanka’s highest-rated series on IMDb with a score of 9.9/10. He also delivered award-winning performances in Maddahana, Ahanna Kenek Na, and Sudu Andagena Kalu Awidin.\n\nIn recognition of his enduring contribution, Mendis has received multiple accolades, including Best Supporting Actor awards at both the Raigam Tele’es and Sumathi Awards, as well as a Merit Award at the Sarasaviya Festival. In 2019, he was elected Secretary of the Sinhala Cultural Institute (Sudarshi), highlighting his commitment to the preservation of Sri Lanka’s cultural heritage.\n\nMendis is married to Geetha Shyamali of Balangoda, and they have two children. His son studies gemology at the University of Moratuwa, while his daughter is pursuing psychology at the University of Cambridge, England.\n\nSelected Television Serials\n\nAhanna Kenek Na as Dunsten Madugalle\n\nAmbu Daruwo\n\nEhipillamak Yata\n\nGangulen Egodata as Sirisena\n\nIndrakeelaya\n\nKadulla\n\nKampitha Vil\n\nKaluwara Anduna\n\nKoombiyo as Dissanayake\n\nMaddahana as Jayasundara\n\nMaha Polowa as Kabara\n\nMama Nemei Mama\n\nMurugasan and Rain\n\nOne Way\n\nPaanamankada\n\nSadgunaakaaraya\n\nSamanala Wasanthaya\n\nSudu Andagena Kalu Awidin as Prof. Amarapala\n\nVinivindimi Andura\n\nThrough this extensive body of work, Lakshman Mendis has become one of Sri Lanka’s most respected and versatile actors.
